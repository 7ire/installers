## BIOS Tweak

In this section it is gonna be listed all the BIOS parameters that are changed from their respective default values.

> [!WARNING]
> Some values should be universal for each manufacture and models, but double check to be 100% sure for each settings.

**AI Tweaker**:

- Ai Overlock Tuner => **DOCP II / EXPO II**

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the RAM speed is the highest you can get.

- FLCK freq => **1/3 of you MAX speed**, in my case 2000Mhz
